# The three bears

Once upon a time, there were three bears
who lived in a house in the woods.
The first bear's name was Papa Bear,
and he was very big and very strong.
The second bear's name was Mama Bear,
and she was very nice and very smart.
The third bear's name was Baby Bear,
and he was very small and very cute.
One day, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear
went for a walk in the woods.
They saw a tree with a sign on it.
The sign said, "Do Not Climb This Tree."
Papa Bear said, "Let's climb the tree!"
Mama Bear said, "No! It's not safe!"
Baby Bear said, "I want to climb the tree!"
Papa Bear said, "If you climb the tree,
I'll give you a cookie."
Baby Bear said, "I'll climb the tree!"
So Baby Bear climbed the tree.
But he slipped and fell out of the tree.
He bumped his head.
He was very, very hurt.
Papa Bear ran to the house
and got a bandage.
He put the bandage on Baby Bear's head.
Baby Bear felt better.
Then Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear
went home.
